This is a weather app project which displays the weather description and degree(both fahrenheit and celcius) for the searched location. It uses visual crossing api to fetch real time data about weather at various locations.

What have I learnt in this project?

- Running asynchronous javascript using async/await.
- How to fetch API.
- Various things about securing the API key.
